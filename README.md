# Algorithmic Trading with Python

Repository that contains code to conduct some algorithmic trading, using `yfinance` to import historical stock price data, and perform some simple trading strategies. The aim of this project is to gain some experience in algorithmic trading, as well as machine learning strategies.

### Regression models
Linear Regression models from Scikit Learn are used to make forecasting predictions into the future. Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. In this context, the historical stock price data serves as the independent variable, and the future stock prices are the dependent variable.

The linear regression model is trained on the historical data to learn the underlying trend and relationships. Once trained, the model can be used to predict future stock prices based on the learned relationships. This method is particularly useful for capturing linear trends in the data and making short-term predictions.

The script will import the historical stock price data for the specified period, train the Linear Regression model on this data, and generate future price predictions. These predictions can then be used to make trading decisions, such as generating buy or sell signals based on the forecasted price movements.

### Trading Strategies
- Moving Average strategy involves using moving averages to smooth out price data and identify trends. A moving average is calculated by taking the average of a stock's price over a specific number of periods. In this strategy, trading signals are generated based on the crossover of moving averages. For example, a buy signal is generated when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, indicating an upward trend. Conversely, a sell signal is generated when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, indicating a downward trend. This strategy helps traders to filter out noise and focus on the overall direction of the market.
- Hidden Markov Model (HMM) strategy involves using Hidden Markov Models to identify hidden states in the market and make trading decisions based on the predicted state transitions. An HMM is a statistical model that assumes the system being modeled is a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. In this strategy, the HMM is trained on historical stock price data to learn the underlying states of the market, such as bull, bear, or sideways trends. Once trained, the model can infer the current state of the market and predict future state transitions. Trading decisions are made based on these predictions, with buy signals generated when the model predicts a transition to a bullish state and sell signals generated when a transition to a bearish state is predicted.
- Donchian Channel strategy involves using the highest high and the lowest low over a specific period to create upper and lower bands. A buy signal is generated when the price breaks above the upper band, and a sell signal is generated when the price falls below the lower band.
- Decision Tree strategy involves using a decision tree algorithm to make trading decisions based on historical data. The decision tree is trained to classify whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock based on various input features such as moving averages, volume, and other technical indicators. This strategy aims to capture patterns in the data that can be used to predict future price movements and make informed trading decisions.
- Kalman Filter Trend strategy involves using a Kalman filter to estimate the underlying trend of a stock price series. The Kalman filter is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, to produce estimates of unknown variables. In this strategy, the Kalman filter is applied to smooth out the noise in the stock price data and identify the true trend. Trading decisions are made based on the estimated trend, with buy signals generated when the trend is upward and sell signals generated when the trend is downward.
- Kalman Filter Mean Reversion strategy involves using a Kalman filter to model the stock price as following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is a type of mean-reverting stochastic process. The Kalman filter is used to estimate the parameters of the process and the current state of the stock price. Trading decisions are made based on the deviation of the current price from the estimated mean. A buy signal is generated when the price is significantly below the mean, indicating that the price is likely to revert upwards. Conversely, a sell signal is generated when the price is significantly above the mean, indicating that the price is likely to revert downwards.
- Random Forest strategy involves using a Random Forest algorithm to make trading decisions based on historical data. A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This strategy leverages the power of multiple decision trees to capture complex patterns in the data and improve prediction accuracy. Trading decisions are made based on the aggregated predictions of the forest, with buy, sell, or hold signals generated based on the consensus of the trees.
- Neural Network strategy involves using a neural network algorithm to make trading decisions based on historical data. Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain, capable of capturing complex patterns and relationships in the data. In this strategy, a neural network is trained on historical stock price data and other relevant features to predict future price movements. The network learns to identify patterns that are indicative of buy, sell, or hold signals. Once trained, the neural network can be used to generate trading signals in real-time, leveraging its ability to generalize from past data to make informed predictions about future price movements.

### Usage
To use, open `trader.py`, and change the settings as desired.
- set the ticker to the company (e.g. "AAPL" for Apple)
- set the period to a time period of interest
- set the number of forecast days for the regression model to predict into the future
- set which trading strategy to use (e.g. "Neural Network")
- set whether to plot the data or not (e.g. "True")

The script will first import the historical stock price data for the time period specified, then will run the trading strategy algorithm on the historical data to generate a series of buy, sell or hold signals. These signals are backtested with a simple algorithm on an initial investment amount, and all relevant plots are shown.
